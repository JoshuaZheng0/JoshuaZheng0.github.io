# About Me
Hi, I'm Joshua Zheng, a Computer Science student at the University of Maryland, College Park, with a deep passion for coding, problem-solving, and creating impactful digital experiences. I'm currently on track to graduate in May 2028 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

My journey in tech began in high school at William Fremd in Palatine, IL, where I graduated with honors in 2024, holding a GPA of 3.9/4.0 and a weighted GPA of 4.989. My academic rigor was complemented by a variety of extracurriculars, including editing the high school newspaper and competing in varsity-level cross country and track. It was also here that I honed my technical skills and developed a fascination for both the theoretical and practical aspects of computing.

Over the summers, I've had the opportunity to work on some fascinating projects and gain diverse professional experience. In Summer 2024, I created a 360° virtual tour for a private estate, integrating aerial drone footage and 360-degree photos into a professional website. I also contributed to the business side of things as a Sales Intern for Elegante Cuisine Inc., where I helped manage payments and customer communications. Additionally, I took on a teaching role in 2023, where I introduced kids to coding in Python and Lua, sparking their interest in STEM.

Beyond the classroom and professional experiences, I’m an avid project developer. I’ve set up a Debian Home Server using an old laptop, developed a 2D gambling simulation game in Unity, and even created a social media platform for sharing memes. My technical toolkit includes proficiency in Java, C#, HTML, CSS, and Python, as well as a strong background in photography and videography, with expertise in Photoshop.

I'm honored to have received the UMD President’s Scholarship and several other accolades, including being an Illinois State Scholar and an AP Scholar with Distinction. My accomplishments in athletics include placing 6th in the IHSA Sectionals Long Jump in 2023.

Driven by coffee and endless opportunities in life, I’m always eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what technology can do. Feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect and explore how we can work together!
